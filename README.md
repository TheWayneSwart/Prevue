# Prevue - Vue.js and Vuetify.js SaaS Boilerplate

A boilerplate template for building Software as a Service (SaaS) dashboard applications with Vue.js and Vuetify.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Prevue is designed to serve as a comprehensive starting point for SaaS admin dashboard projects, covering most of the basic aspects and components needed to kickstart a new application. Built with modern web technologies and best practices, it provides a solid foundation for rapid development.

## ðŸš©Features and Components
- Desktop widgets components.
- Light and Dark mode.
- Apex charts.

### A Few Things to Note:
- Prevue uses JavaScript instead of TypeScript.
- It requires manual imports of components, views, and composables (no auto-imports).
- All dependencies must be explicitly imported where they are used.
- All my examples use the Vuejs Composition API.

Even though this is a personal project, I thought others might also find it useful. It is also my first ever public GitHub repo, so it will serve as a learning curve in this regard too.
